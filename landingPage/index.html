        Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.
    There are many ways to tackle a project like this, and it can be overwhelming to look at a blank HTML document 
    and not know where to start. Our suggestion: take it one section at a time. The website you’re creating has 4 
    main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the 
    top is always a solid plan.
    For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. 
    In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. You’ll probably have to go back to the HTML once you start styling, 
    but bouncing back and forth from the beginning will take more time and may cause more frustration. 
    (Note: you don’t need to use more than one stylesheet. Using only one CSS file is adequate for this project).
    Many of the elements on this page are very similar to things you saw in our flexbox exercises… feel free to go 
    back to those if you need a refresher.
    You do not need to make this project responsive. That means you don’t have to adjust your design for different 
    screen sizes, zoom levels, or mobile devices. For now, just focus on making it look good on a regular computer 
    screen. You’ll learn how to handle different screen sizes later.
    When you finish, don’t forget to push it up to GitHub!
